# A Notes-First StyleSheet for TaskPaper 3.8 and up

![Preview of a TaskPaper with the Light StyleSheet applied](preview.png)

This StyleSheet for [TaskPaper 3.8 and up](http://www.taskpaper.com) is great if you:

* Are using macOS 10.14 Mojave or later and TaskPaper 3.8 or later
* Use *notes* items a lot, and tasks (dashed items) just a little
* Find the handle (the circle next to the lines) handy mostly to collapse indented items
* Prefer URLs to appear discreetly, but still look clickable
* Prefer to use the keyboard to cut-paste items to re-order them over using draggable handles to re-order items (on the Mac anyway)
* Want a Style Sheet that's compatible with macOS Dark Mode

## Here's how to install the StyleSheet

1. [Download the zip][download] and open the zip folder
2. `Window` menu > `StyleSheet` > `Open StyleSheet Folder` *<-- from within TaskPaper*
3. Copy `Notes First.less` from the zip folder to the `StyleSheet` Folder
4. `Window` menu > `StyleSheet` > `Notes First.less` *<-- also from within TaskPaper*
